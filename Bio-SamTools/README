Perl interface to the SAMtools sequence alignment interface.
See http://samtools.sourceforge.net/.

To compile this module, you must first download, unpack and compile
SAMtools 0.1.4 or higher in some accessible directory. AS OF SAMTOOLS
VERSION 0.1.4, YOU MUST RUN "make -f makefile.generic" IN THE
DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY IN ORDER TO CREATE THE REQUIRED LIBBAM.A
LIBRARY FILE.

Then set the environment variable SAMTOOLS to point to this directory
and run:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  (sudo) ./Build install

The documentation is pending, but you'll be able to figure out
much of the API by looking at the unit tests in t/01sam.t.
