This is a Perl interface to the UCSC Genome Browser BigWig and BigBed
files, which are indexed genome feature databases that can be randomly
accessed across the network. Please see
http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html for information about
creating these files.

To compile this module, you must first download, unpack and compile
the Jim Kent source tree, located at
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip. Please follow the
instructions contained in the source tree to create the main library
file jkweb.a

This module will prompt you for the location of the Kent source tree
the first time you build it. This should be the "src" directory which
contains the subdirectories "inc" and "lib". If you do not wish to be
prompted, set the environment variable KENT_SRC to point to the
directory.

You will also need to install a recent version of Bio::Perl from CPAN.

Then run:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  (sudo) ./Build install

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you encounter problems during compiling, you may need to set the
environment variable MACHTYPE to point to the appropriate architecture
for your system. This is described in the installation directions for
the Jim Kent source tree.
